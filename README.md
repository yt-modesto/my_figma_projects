## ðŸš€ about me

Although I was responsible for the design of most of the applications, I want to make it clear that I don't have any course in this area so please disregard the lack of care in the layouts shown here, I'm almost a programmer so my biggest concern is with the functionality of the applications but these functionalities need a visual representation. I accept constructive criticism, if you want, send a pull request and I'll look at it :writing_hand:
